**Marketplace First, Network Later**

**Intro:**

We need a way to get stores cooperating with us such that we can offer a
full platform.

We will offer to create free online marketplace, if they give us their
inventory, which we can later use to make recommendations on inventory.

This method has the benefit that it skips the chicken-egg problem, as
each retail store can be treated independently (although with great
overhead) and no great benefit will come from already having other
stores in the system beforehand. This makes it easier to sell to stores
and they won’t feel like they’re suffering the brunt of being the first
ones on an empty platform.

For the retail store:

-   Free online presence

-   If hooked up to UberRUSH, Postmates, or other courier service then free delivery.

-   Potential for more eyeballs they would normally not have

For us:

-   Hands on store inventory

-   Store added to platform

-   Potential early adopter found for future tests and ideas

-   Candidates to then give recommendations on what products they should be delivering

-   Candidate to later add to supply chain

**Strategy**

**Phase 1: Build Rapport**

1.  Pick an area with enough small retail stores **without** an online presence, to target. Although not important right now, ideally all the stores are located nearby (1-2mi radius?) such that in time we can saturate an area. Saturation will become important later.

2.  Find a store willing to work with us, trade inventory for online marketplace.

3.  Create marketplace for the store (ideally in some simple and easy to replicate fashion)

    a.  Although each marketplace can be “independent” for now, all data needs to be collected and aggregated

    b.  Ideally, a single marketplace exists that each store is a part of such that to customers, there only exists a single entity from which to buy (i.e like Amazon)

4.  Fill with inventory that we update as much as possible

5.  Connect marketplace to search engines/recommendations engines (G+, Yelp, etc) for increased traffic

6.  First attempt at advertising our marketplace platform to attract more stores onto the platform and attract customers to the marketplace.

    a.  Typical ads, social media, etc.

    b.  Stickers and posters with logo, similar to the “We’re on Yelp!” stickers.

7.  Continue getting inventory from the store as frequently as possible

8.  Given traffic and search patterns, build recommendations we can offer the store

9.  Suggest these to the owner and try to get them to change their buying habits based on these recommendations

**Phase 2: Deep Integration with stores**

1.  First attempt to charge:

    a.  charge for the recommendations which have now proven useful

    b.  charge for online deliveries (courier service) through store.

2.  Gain deep control of inventory (integration with their POS or other strategy that provides near real time inventory count)

3.  Leverage the growing marketplace for extensive analytics across a saturated area.

    a.  Ideally search engines now respect our marketplace (at least in certain areas) and pagerank is impressive enough to boost eyeballs.

    b.  Boost pagerank as needed as it will make adoption easier for new stores we onboard

4.  Take control over inventory via our ARS which can now make impressive predictions based on aggregated data from several stores.

    a.  charge? maybe not if we want easy penetration

5.  Build trust with store owner on our ARS, such that inventory control is autonomous or nearly autonomous and they’ll be willing to completely switch over to rely on us for supply.

**Phase 3: Deep Integration with Territories**

1.  Bring a tight geographical area (territory) to phase 2 saturation.

2.  Offer store owners to resupply through us.

    a.  If they’re already on ARS, this is seamless as they would be abstracted from the supplier already

    b.  charge? Can we buy in bulk here at a discount? If so we can take the margin.

3.  Get store owners used to the idea of storing inventory for us

    a.  Store’s will become wholesalers and storage.

    b.  We can offer monetary incentives so they’ll want to hold onto inventory

4.  Offer “just in time inventory” using our networked storage centers.

    a.  Move storage inventory from several stores to where they’re needed.

5.  Offer to let stores “sell” their inventory and unused stock to other stores (although abstracted, they don’t know who’s buying it), moving them into becoming independent wholesalers.

    a.  A notification arrives telling them they can sell X stock at Y price.

    b.  Allow for an auction where stock owners can bid to sell? Take a margin?

        i.  ARS can play a role, potentially becoming a full Automated Stock Distribution engine (ASD) where owners set preferences and it makes wholesale decisions for them.

6.  Deep integration into a territory is achieved once we have build a network of stores that simultaneously act as wholesalers and storage centers and we can offer “just in time inventory” to the entire territory.

**Phase 4: Total world domination**

1.  Bring several disjoint territories to phase 3.

2.  Spread internationally.

3.  Become the leader in supply and wholesale distribution driving market trends

    a.  We are a logistics company, what advanced technology spaces can we revolutionize with the massive network in place?

4.  Become a true technology company moving into different fields

    a.  Mapping & logistics for supply chain

    b.  Retail store advancement, A/B testing products, fully automate stores

    c.  Autonomous trucks, autonomous freights
