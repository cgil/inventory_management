**Introduction**

It’s important to keep an open line of communication with SBO’s as they
may become future partners of our platform. At the same time, it is
currently more important to answer crucial questions than it is to
establish a long term relationship. If we had to choose, getting answers
is currently a higher priority than building relationships, which will
become the next phase of operations.

As we have no connections, the best way to meet SBO’s is currently to
walk into a local store and speak with the attendant. As it’s possible
that the first person we meet may not have enough context/information on
the shop, **first** ensure the attendant **can** answer our questions,
if not, find someone who can.

We’ve narrowed down our search to two locations for convenience yet they
happen to fall into a good range UWS (more upscale, older crowd, richer)
and Williamsburg (gentrified, younger crowd). Additionally we may want
information on a third location to representative of a poorer
neighborhood (deeper Brooklyn?).

**Process**

1)  Walk into a new store in a concentrated area in UWS or Williamsburg.

2)  Speak with the nearest attendant

3)  Find the owner, manager, or person with enough context to answer our questions

4)  Establish a time at their best convenience to ask a few questions, what’s best for them?

    a.  If no best time can we offer a monetary incentive?

5)  Ask questions, stick to the unknown priority items first as we may not be able to attain all the information for a single vendor.

6)  Build a rapport with the vendor and make them know you care for their businesses well-being. We’re gathering information to make their lives easier.

7)  Try to get their email or phone number, ask if they’d be willing to speak with you again in the future.

8)  Add their contact information and notes to this aggregate doc.
