# Inventory Management - Case Study
Strategic analysis and customer studies of how to integrate POS analytics and automate inventory management for small NYC vendors.

The goal of this project was to investigate how to sell analytics and eventually automate inventory management and tracking for local NYC vendors lacking technology solutions.

My friend Josh also joined to review ideas, comment on proposed strategies and playbooks, and ingest customer feedback.
